      <p>once upon time there was box living beside another box that first box wanted friend but the second box hated the first box. for the first killed the second box's mother. The second box vowed revenge on the first on the first through poison. "Would you like an apple?" asked the second box. "I would loved an apple," said the first box. the first box bit into the apple and exhaled sigh of pure joy. "This app is the best apple I've ever had." said the first box.
        the first box drop to the floor, DEAD!!! The second shed a tear "my job is done, I am finally free." </p>
